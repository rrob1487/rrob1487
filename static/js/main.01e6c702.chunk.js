The alarm clock was a Raspberry Pi with a touchscreen and custom GUI. The interface allowed the alarm clock to show the current time, set an alarm, and turn off the screen so that the light from the display did not keep me awake. It also had a microphone and a speaker, and it ran the open source Google Assistant library in the background",Tools:"The user interface was a Java application that I created using the native JSwing library. The touchscreen came with its own software which was used because of the ease of set up. To use the Google Assistant library, I set up a Google Cloud Account and configured the proper authentication tokens. Overall, getting everything to work independently presented very few challenges.",Lessons:"Like many things in life, this project was great in theory, but not functional in practice. The software for the touchscreen and the Google Assistant required different versions of Raspbian and as a result, the libraries were incompatible, and I was forced to demonstrate the project in two different parts, hot swapping micro SD cards to show the different pieces. This issue could have been addressed by using a different touchscreen, or by using a HDMI enabled screen and some additional hardware buttons, but due to time constraints, I wasn\u2019t able to procure the additional hardware necessary. This project was a great lesson in the importance of interoperability and system testing, and if I were to do it again, I would verify library compatibility beforehand. ",DateFinished:"Dec 2017"},{ProjectName:"IoT Drapes",ProjectDescription:"After the success with my MIDI board project, I attempted another project using a micro controller device. This project was a window covering that could be controlled from my phone/laptop. The end design included interfacing the window covering with an alarm clock so that the blackout curtains would retract when the alarm sounded, and the sun would shine in when it was time to get up. ",Tools:"For this project I used a Wi-Fi enabled micro controller, a 6V continuous rotation servo motor, a long dowel as the \u201ccurtain rod\u201d, and several yards of blackout fabric. The fabric was wrapped around and attached to the dowel which was mounted above the window on custom made mounting hardware which allowed the entire system to rotate freely.  One end of the dowel was attached to the servo motor. As the servo would spin, the fabric would wrap around the dowel, allowing more or less light through the window, depending on whether the fabric was going up or down. I was able to find a GitHub library that had Arduino code to host a web server that functioned properly on my hardware, and from there I just added the code to parse the server requests, and move the motor accordingly.",Lessons:"This project presented the most learning opportunities, including basic household DIY tips, sewing tips and networking protocols.  The weight of the window covering presented challenges in keeping it on the wall; a better mounting system would be critical in a redesign.  Initially, to get the window covering functioning, I parsed the URL of HTTP GET requests and I did not design a GUI or user interface.  To remotely control the window covering movement I had to submit requests to the IP (which was not static) followed by a number between 0 and 100, which corresponded to the percent of window to cover. For example, if I wanted to put the shades all the way down, I would type 10.10.10.24/100 into my browser and it would start spinning.  This was problematic, mostly because of a lack of input sanitation.   This \u201cbuggy\u201d system led to the window covering randomly activating, often, in the middle of the night. Overall, the window covering did function, and could be deployed remotely.  However, the physical design, coupled with the unsophisticated electronic interface, led to less than optimal operation.  If I were to design this project now, a total redesign of the hardware and software would result, but the main takeaways from this project are that a basic understanding of networking is crucial for any IoT devices and prototypes of the hardware would shed light on physical limitations prior to launching.",DateFinished:"Aug 2017"},{ProjectName:"Blackjack",ProjectDescription:"This blackjack application holds a special place in my heart because it is the first program I wrote on my own. Before I ever took a course in programming, I learned to write code by watching YouTube tutorials. A few lessons into the series, I learned how to use conditionals, and I got excited because it was the first logic I had ever seen outside of Minecraft. The excitement inspired me to write my own command line blackjack game. It was all written in main, the variable names were impossible to understand, and there were many, many, nested conditionals. But I was able to get it to function, and I am super proud of that. As I started taking college courses and becoming a better programmer, I rewrote the game a few different times, each time incorporating new knowledge garnered from my classes. The final iteration of the game was made after I learned about the 4 Object-Oriented Programming Principals. This time, it featured a full GUI and the ability to play online using a peer to peer connection. ",Tools:"Every iteration of the blackjack game was written in Java. The final version used JSwing for the GUI, and socket layer networking for the peer to peer connection. ",Lessons:"Since I redid this project many times, there were many different skills I applied and refined, but the most important skill I learned from this project was multithreading. When I was writing my final iteration, the GUI had issues when it needed to refresh. As a result of that issue, and with research and through consultation with experts,  I was able to finish the project by moving the GUI into its own thread. I credit a lot of my successes as a programmer to my blackjack games, as they allowed me to challenge myself outside of class, and helped me to put a lot of my newly learned skills to the test. I will probably never do another blackjack game, but if I do, I will do the bulk of the work in solidity, and focus on writing efficient smart contracts so that I can decentralize it and do payments with real cryptocurrency.

The purpose of the keyboard is to act as a drum rack so that users can play sounds and loops at the press of a button. ",Tools:"Arcade buttons were used for the inputs, wood for the base, and plastic as the shell, which I molded and shaped using heat. For development I used the Arduino IDE and an Arduino Uno board. A Hairless-MIDISerial software was used as a bridge to test the code before using Atmel Flip to flash the board and make it a fully functional MIDI device.",Lessons:"There were multiple challenges associated with this project including software debugging and base/shell design issues.  The primary lessons learned from this project were how to problem solve and improvise. This project challenged my dedication but my ability to fight through the adversity and setbacks and complete my goals is something that I am proud of even today. If I were to do this project again, I would modify hardware and perhaps choose different components. Based on my experience, I would use an Arduino Mega so that I have open pins for lights and potentiometers. I would also choose different design materials for the shell and base that were lighter weight and more flexible.
